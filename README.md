Invisible-Application-Starter
=============================

Invisible Application Starter is a semi-invisible application that runs in the background, scanning its special monitor folder for text files dumped by other applications. These text files simply contain an executable path of the application desired to be launched. Invisible Application Starter launches at start up and can only be killed via the Windows Task Manager.
